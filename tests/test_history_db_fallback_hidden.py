"""Regression: the DB fallback in get_session_history must hide the same
messages the in-memory path hides.

The in-memory branch skips messages whose metadata has ``hidden`` (e.g.
compaction summaries that are kept for AI context but not shown to the user).
The DB fallback (taken when the in-memory history is empty, e.g. after a
restart) built the client response from every DB row with no such filter, so
hidden messages leaked to the client on DB-served sessions. The rebuilt
in-memory ``session.history`` must still keep them, though, so only the response
is filtered.

get_session_history depends on the DB, the session manager and a FastAPI
request, so this pins the regression at the source level (as other route tests
in this repo do).
