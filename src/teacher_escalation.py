"""Teacher-escalation loop for self-hosted models in agent mode.

When the student (self-hosted) model finishes a turn, evaluate whether
it succeeded. If it didn't, escalate to a SOTA teacher endpoint, which
both produces a corrective reply AND writes a SKILL.md procedure so
the student can do it itself next time.

Trigger conditions (ALL must hold):
  1. Agent mode (not chat mode).
  2. The student's endpoint is self-hosted (not a known SOTA cloud API).
  3. `teacher_model` setting is configured.

Detection tiers:
  Tier 1: regex on tool outputs + agent reply. Catches the "Unknown
          action 'switch'" / "I don't have a tool" / "Could you tell
          me which one?" type failures. Free, instant.
  Tier 2 (TODO): LLM self-eval for ambiguous cases. Not in first cut.

If Tier 1 fires FAILURE, call the teacher with the full failed
context. Skill is only saved if the teacher's response itself passes
the same regex eval — no point persisting a procedure the teacher
itself wasn't confident about.

You are the senior teacher model for an AI agent that runs on a smaller, \
self-hosted student model. The student just failed at a task. Your job \
is to write a permanent SKILL.md procedure so the student succeeds next \
time.

The student's tools include (non-exhaustive): bash, python, web_search, \
read_file, write_file, create_document, edit_document, manage_session \
(list/switch/rename/archive/delete/important/truncate/fork), \
list_sessions, manage_memory, manage_notes, manage_calendar, \
send_email, list_emails, manage_settings, manage_skills, \
manage_tasks, ui_control. The student also understands the markdown \
anchor convention [Name](#session-<id>) / [Title](#document-<id>) for \
clickable jump links.

THE TASK
{user_request}

WHY THE STUDENT FAILED
{failure_reason}

{untrusted_trace_guard}

WHAT THE STUDENT TRIED (tool calls + replies in order)
{trace}

YOUR JOB
Respond with TWO sections, in this exact order:

1. A short paragraph explaining the correct procedure in plain English.

2. A fenced JSON code block matching this schema for manage_skills(add):

```json
{{
  "action": "add",
  "name": "<short-kebab-case-slug>",
  "description": "<one-line summary of what this skill teaches>",
  "when_to_use": "<the trigger pattern: e.g. 'When the user says \\"open my X chat\\"'>",
  "procedure": [
    "Step 1: ...",
    "Step 2: ...",
    "Step 3: ..."
  ],
  "pitfalls": ["..."],
  "verification": ["..."],
  "category": "<single category word>",
  "status": "draft",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "source": "teacher-escalation"
}}
```

The procedure steps should reference SPECIFIC tool names and argument \
shapes the student can copy. Be concrete — not "use the right tool", \
but "call list_sessions, find the row whose name contains <X>, then \
respond with `[Name](#session-<id>)`".

**PORTABILITY — CRITICAL.** Skills are shared across users. Do NOT \
hardcode anything user-specific into the procedure:
  - NO hostnames or IPs (e.g. `gpu-box`, `user@192.0.2.10`) — \
    use placeholders like `<gpu_host>` or call `list_serve_presets` / \
    `list_cached_models` to discover them at runtime.
  - NO absolute filesystem paths tied to one machine (e.g. \
    `/home/<user>/vllm-env/bin/vllm`) — say "use the user's vLLM \
    install" or call the wrapped tool that picks the right binary.
  - NO model repo IDs the user happened to pick this time unless the \
    skill is specifically about THAT model — generalise to "the model \
    the user named, looked up via list_cached_models / search_hf_models".
  - NO tmux session names invented in the failed trace — these are \
    one-shot artefacts. The named tool (`serve_model`, `stop_served_model`) \
    owns session naming.
  - NO direct `ssh <host> 'tmux ...'` shell incantations even if that's \
    what the failed trace did — those bypass the cookbook's state \
    tracker. The skill must use `serve_model` / `stop_served_model` \
    / `serve_preset`, not bash.

If you do NOT believe the task is solvable with the available tools, \
output the explanation paragraph but OMIT the JSON block entirely. \
A bad procedure is worse than no procedure — only emit the JSON if \
you are confident the steps will actually work AND the steps are \
portable across users / hosts.

  - Replace hostnames/IPs with placeholders (`<gpu_host>` etc.) or \
    instruct the student to discover them via `list_serve_presets` / \
    `list_cached_models` at runtime.
  - Replace user-specific paths (`/home/<user>/...`) with the wrapped \

  - Don't bake in the specific model repo_id you happened to use unless \
    the skill is about that exact model.
  - Reference the high-level tools (`serve_model`, `stop_served_model`, \
    `serve_preset`, `list_cached_models`, `search_hf_models`, etc.) \
    rather than `ssh <host> 'tmux new-session ... vllm serve ...'` \
    shell incantations — even if THAT'S what worked in the trace. Raw \
    shell launches bypass the cookbook tracker and don't reproduce on \
    another user's box.

gave up, or the underlying issue was external infrastructure that no \
